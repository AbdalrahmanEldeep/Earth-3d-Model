# Earth 3D Model with moons

This project is a JavaScript-based interactive 3D model of the Earth with a moon orbiting around it. It uses the three.js library to create and render the 3D scene. The scene consists of a starfield background, the Earth, and the moon, along with a directional light and a point light. The Earth has a texture of land, ocean, ice, and clouds, while the moon is white and reflective.

## Features

- Interactive: The model is interactive and responds to user input. The user can zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel, and the model will rotate and adjust the lighting accordingly.

- Realistic: The model is designed to be as realistic as possible. The Earth's texture accurately represents its land, ocean, ice, and cloud cover, and the moon has a realistic reflective surface.

- Smooth Animation: The model's animation is smooth and realistic. The Earth rotates on its axis, and the moon orbits around the Earth while rotating on its own axis.

## Getting Started

To use the Earth 3D Model with moons, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The model will be displayed in the browser window, and the user can interact with it using the mouse scroll wheel.

## Dependencies

The Earth 3D Model with moons depends on the following libraries:

- three.js - a JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D scenes.

- tween.js - a JavaScript library for creating smooth animations.

- Both libraries are included as external scripts in the HTML file and are loaded from CDNs.

# Acknowledgments

This project is based on the Earth and Moon Demo example from the three.js library. The example has been modified and enhanced to create the Earth 3D Model with moons.
